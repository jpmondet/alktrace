# Alktrace

The objective is to get an insight of the path taken even after NAT happening
(which obfuscates the path) done by Service implementation. 
Protocol & port must be customizable depending on the service definition.

If this is not possible, the second objective is to give all the infos of the 
pods/nodes/svc/etc aggregated in a nice to help understanding what's happening
after the NAT.
